# ⌚️ Companion.Garmin 

A WheelLog companion for Garmin smartwatches

This app is a rebuild from ground-up of an original Garmin app. I made this app to be with better UI, alarms working, and full support of new watches and their features.

## 🛠 Development/Building

I use a build system called kumitateru, and here is a list of commands you can use:

`./kumitateru build` - assembles a release .iq file

`./kumitateru build --target <device>` - builds for a specific device

`./kumitateru run --target <device>` - runs the app in a simulator
